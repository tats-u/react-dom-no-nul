## Usage

Update `react-dom` to 18.3.1 before the following steps.

### Patch

#### npm & Yarn v1

Use [`patch-package` package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package).

After `patch-package` (and additional `postinstall-postinstall` only for Yarn) is installed and `"postinstall": "patch-package"` is added to your `package.json`, run the following command.

```sh
curl -LfO --output-dir node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-server.node.development.js https://github.com/tats-u/react-dom-no-nul/raw/850327cbc752bf95e94114699861d142741f4181/cjs/react-dom-server.node.development.js
curl -LfO --output-dir node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-server.node.production.min.js https://github.com/tats-u/react-dom-no-nul/raw/850327cbc752bf95e94114699861d142741f4181/cjs/react-dom-server.node.production.min.js
npx patch-package react-dom
```

Commit the generated `patches/react-dom+18.3.1.patch` file to your repository.

#### pnpm

Use the builtin `pnpm patch` command.

```sh
pnpm patch react-dom@18.3.1
# Copy the path of the generated temporary directory
# Assuming it is /path/to/temp
WORKSPACE_DIR=/path/to/temp
# PowerShell: $WORKSPACE_DIR = "/path/to/temp"
curl -LfO --output-dir "$WORKSPACE_DIR" https://github.com/tats-u/react-dom-no-nul/raw/850327cbc752bf95e94114699861d142741f4181/cjs/react-dom-server.node.development.js
curl -LfO --output-dir "$WORKSPACE_DIR" https://github.com/tats-u/react-dom-no-nul/raw/850327cbc752bf95e94114699861d142741f4181/cjs/react-dom-server.node.production.min.js
pnpm patch commit "$WORKSPACE_DIR"
```

Commit the generated `patches/react-dom@18.3.1.patch` file and the modified `package.json` to your repository.

#### Yarn v2+

It supports the builtin `yarn patch` command like pnpm.

See [the Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/features/patching) for details.

In case this repository were tampered by a cracker who had hijacked my account, please use the commit ID instead of the branch or the tag name.

```json
{
  "name": "your-react-app",
  "dependencies": {
    "some-react-framework": "^1.2.3",
    "other-dependencies": "^4.5.6",
    "react-dom": "github:tats-u/react-dom-no-nul#850327cbc752bf95e94114699861d142741f4181"
  }
}
```

Then, run `npm i` or `yarn` to install the package.

## When to use this patch

You can use this package **until you upgrade React to 19.x** if you're using React 18.x. That patch has been applied to React 19.x or newer. If you upgrade React to 19.x or newer, you can replace this package with an official version by removing `overrides` from `package.json`.

You do *not* need to use this package at all **if you're using Next.js** because it uses newer unstable versions of React.

You do *not* need to use this package at all if you don't use either of Node.js or npm packages. This bug can appear only when you use frameworks depending on the Node.js stream (and its polyfills in other JavaScript engines).
